# Introduction

TCGAbiolinksGUI was created to help users more comfortable with graphical user interfaces (GUI) to search, download and analyze Cancer data. 
It offers a graphical user interface to the R/Bioconductor package [TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks/) [@TCGAbiolinks], which is able to access The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) through its  
[GDC Application Programming Interface (API)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-application-programming-interface-api).
Additional packages from Bioconductor are included, such as [ComplexHeatmap](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/) package [@Gu20052016] to aid in visualizing the data, 
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) [@yao2015inferring] to identify regulatory enhancers using gene expression + DNA methylation data + motif analysis and 
[Pathview](http://bioconductor.org/packages/pathview/) [@luo2013pathview] for pathway-based data integration and visualization.

The GUI was created using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), a Web Application Framework for R, and uses
several packages to provide advanced features that can enhance Shiny apps, such as [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) to add JavaScript actions for the app,
[shinydashboard](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard) to add dashboards and [shinyFiles](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) to provide an API for client side access to the server file system. 
A running version of the GUI is found in [shinyapps.io](https://tcgabiolinksgui.shinyapps.io/demo/)

This work has been supported by a grant from Henry Ford Hospital (H.N.) and by the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP](http://www.fapesp.br/) (2016/01389-7 to T.C.S. & H.N. and 2015/07925-5 to H.N.) the BridgeIRIS project, funded by INNOVIRIS, Region de Bruxelles Capitale, Brussels, Belgium, and by GENomic profiling of Gastrointestinal Inflammatory-Sensitive CANcers (GENGISCAN), Belgian FNRS PDR (T100914F to A.C., C.O. & G.B.). T.C.S. and B.P.B. were supported by the NCI Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program, NIH/NCI grant 1U01CA184826.

# GDC data menus
## Detailed explanation

For a detailed manual for this section please access this link:

1. [Data menu manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-8N2fjttG-X1BoNlNnUnpVMWc/view?usp=sharing)
2. [Manage SummarizedExperiment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-8N2fjttG-TVVOcTNFRlh3YXM/view?usp=sharing)

## Menu: Get GDC data menu

### Sub-menu: Molecular data

In this sub-menu, the user will be able to search, download and prepare The NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC)  data for analysis.
The first step is to search for GDC open data access with the Advanced search box. The search results will be summarized in plots in the center of the screen. The second step is to download and prepare the data into an R object 
to be used in the analysis steps.

![GDC search menu: Main window.](tcgasearch.png)

####  Useful information

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Different sources: Legacy vs Harmonized</div>
<div class="panel-body">


There are two available sources to download GDC data using TCGAbiolinks:
- GDC Legacy Archive: provides access to an unmodified copy of data that was previously stored in
  [CGHub](https://cghub.ucsc.edu/) and in the TCGA Data Portal hosted by the TCGA Data Coordinating Center (DCC), in which uses
  as references GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh36 (hg18).
- GDC harmonized database: data available was harmonized against GRCh38 (hg38) using GDC Bioinformatics Pipelines
  which provides methods to the standardization of biospecimen and
  clinical data.

</div>
</div>


<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Understanding the barcode</div>
<div class="panel-body">

A TCGA barcode is composed of a collection of identifiers. Each specifically identifies a TCGA data element. Refer to the following figure for an illustration of how metadata identifiers comprise a barcode. An aliquot barcode contains the highest number of identifiers.

Example: 

- Aliquot barcode: TCGA-G4-6317-02A-11D-2064-05
- Participant: TCGA-G4-6317
- Sample: TCGA-G4-6317-02

For more information check [TCGA wiki](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+barcode)
</div>
</div>

#### Advanced search box


The following filters are available to select the data:

* Database
* Project filter
* Data category filter
* Data type filter
* Workflow filter
* Sample type filter
* Platform filter
* List of barcodes
* Clinical filter: gender, race, vital status, tumor stage.

<div class="panel panel-warning">
<div class="panel-heading">Repeated cases (barcodes) </div>
<div class="panel-body">

In the search step, it is important that there are no repeated 
cases, otherwise, the prepare step might not work. If it happens, the search will give you this warning "There are more than one file for the same case." 
To solve this problem, you  probably need to use more filters to correctly select your data. 

As an example of this problem, if you use only Project (i.e "TCGA-ACC") and Data category filter (i.e "Copy Number Variation"), for each sample we have two data types "Copy Number segment" and "Masked Copy Number segment". 

</div>
</div>


#### Download & Prepare box

After the search step, the user can download the data and prepare it into an R object.
The data can be prepared into one of two formats:

* [SummarizedExperiment](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n2/abs/nmeth.3252.html) 
[@huber2015orchestrating]: An R object that contains the sample information matrix (clinical and subtype information),
the assay matrix (i.e DNA methylation beta-values), the features matrix (i.e information for each probe in the DNA methylation assay matrix).
* Data Frame: A simple table with only the assay matrix (i.e Gene expression quantification)

In case a SummarizedExperiment object was selected the user will be able to add more metadata information into the  sample information matrix. By checking "Add gistic2 and mutation information" and giving a list of genes,
the GUI will download GISTIC2 data from the GDAC Firehose and Mutation Annotation Files (MAF) and their information
to the object. This might be useful, for example, if the user wants to evaluate the survival of mutant samples vs non-mutant or if he wants to evaluate it on a heatmap, which can be used as labels.

Finally, the object will be saved with the same name as the file name field.

### Sub-menu: Subtype data

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has reported integrated genome-wide 
studies of various diseases. We have added some of the subtypes defined by these
reports in our package.

The user can visualize the table with the information and save it as csv or R object (rda) file.

### Sub-menu: Clinical data

TCGAbiolinks has provided a few functions to search, download and parse GDC clinical data. 

#### Useful information


<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Different sources</div>
<div class="panel-body">

In GDC database the clinical data can be retrieved from two sources:

- indexed clinical: a refined clinical data that is created using the XML files.
- XML files

There are two main differences:

- XML has more information: radiation, drugs information, follow-ups, biospecimen, etc. So the indexed one is only a subset of the XML files
- The indexed data contains the updated data with the follow-up information. 
  For example: if the patient is alive in the first time clinical data was collect and the in the next follow-up he is dead, 
  the indexed data will show dead. The XML will have two fields, one for the first time saying he is alive (in the clinical part) and the follow-up saying he is dead. You can see this case here: 

</div>
</div>

#### Clinical data inconsistencies

<div class="panel panel-danger">
<div class="panel-heading">Clinical data inconsistencies</div>
<div class="panel-body">

Some inconsistencies have been found in the indexed clinical data and are being
investigated by the GDC team. These inconsistencies are:

- ***Vital status*** field is not correctly updated 
- ***Tumor Grade*** field is not being filled
- ***Progression or Recurrence*** field is not being filled

</div>
</div>

##### Vital status inconsistencies

```{r results = 'hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Get XML files and parse them
clin.query <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-READ", data.category = "Clinical", barcode = "TCGA-F5-6702")
GDCdownload(clin.query)
clinical.patient <- GDCprepare_clinic(clin.query, clinical.info = "patient")
clinical.patient.followup <- GDCprepare_clinic(clin.query, clinical.info = "follow_up")

# Get indexed data
clinical.index <- GDCquery_clinic("TCGA-READ")
```
```{r  echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
select(clinical.patient,vital_status,days_to_death,days_to_last_followup) %>% kable
select(clinical.patient.followup, vital_status,days_to_death,days_to_last_followup) %>% kable
# Vital status should be the same in the follow up table 
filter(clinical.index,submitter_id == "TCGA-F5-6702") %>% 
    select(vital_status,days_to_death,days_to_last_follow_up) %>% kable
```

##### Progression or Recurrence and Grade inconsistancie

```{r results = 'hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Get XML files and parse them
recurrent.samples <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-LIHC",
                             data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
                             data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification", 
                             workflow.type = "HTSeq - Counts",
                             sample.type = 	"Recurrent Solid Tumor")$results[[1]] %>% select(cases)
recurrent.patients <- substr(recurrent.samples$cases,1,12)
clin.query <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-LIHC", data.category = "Clinical", barcode = recurrent.patients)
GDCdownload(clin.query)
clinical.patient <- GDCprepare_clinic(clin.query, clinical.info = "patient") 
```
```{r  echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Get indexed data
GDCquery_clinic("TCGA-LIHC") %>% filter(submitter_id %in% recurrent.patients) %>% 
    select(progression_or_recurrence,days_to_recurrence,tumor_grade) %>% kable

# XML data
clinical.patient %>% select(bcr_patient_barcode,neoplasm_histologic_grade) %>% kable

```

### Sub-menu: Mutation data

In order to download the Mutation Annotation Format (MAF), we provide the user
with an interface to the `GDCquery_maf` function. Briefly, it will download the open access MAF files from
[https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data/Release_Notes/Data_Release_Notes/](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data/Release_Notes/Data_Release_Notes/).
Four separate variant calling pipelines are implemented for GDC data harmonization which are described [here](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/DNA_Seq_Variant_Calling_Pipeline/).

#### Mutation data search box

The available filters are:

* Tumor filter: a TCGA tumor, such as Breast invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA)
* Variant calling pipelines: Four separate variant calling pipelines are implemented for GDC data harmonization. Options: muse, varscan2, somaticsniper, mutect. 


## Menu: Manage summarized Experiment object


To facilitate visualization and modification of the SummarizedExperiment object, we created this menu in which it is possible to visualize the three matrices of the object (assay matrix [i.e. gene expression values], features matrix [i.e. gene information] and sample information matrix). Also,  it is possible to download the sample information matrix as a csv file, and, after modifying it, to upload  and update the SummarizedExperiment object. This might be useful if, for example, the user wants to compare two groups not already pre-defined.

## Menu: ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationship)

This sub-menu will help the user to perform an integrative analysis between DNA methylation and Gene expression using the R/Bioconductor ELMER package [@yao2015inferring].

### Introduction

Recently, many studies suggest that enhancers play a major role as
regulators of cell-specific phenotypes leading to alteration in
transcriptomes related to diseases
[@giorgio2015large; @groschel2014single; @sur2012mice; @yao2015demystifying].
In order to investigate regulatory enhancers that can be located at long
distances upstream or downstream of target genes, Bioconductor offers the
[Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationship
(ELMER)](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) package. This package
is designed to combine DNA methylation and gene expression data from
human tissues to infer multi-level cis-regulatory networks. It uses DNA
methylation to identify enhancers and correlates their state with the
expression of nearby genes to identify one or more transcriptional
targets. Transcription factor (TF) binding site analysis of enhancers is
coupled with expression analysis of all TFs to infer upstream
regulators. This package can be easily applied to TCGA public available
cancer data sets and custom DNA methylation and gene expression data
sets [@yao2015inferring].

[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) analysis has 5 main
steps:

1.  Identify distal enhancer probes on HM450K.

2.  Identify distal enhancer probes with significantly different DNA
    methylation level in control group and experiment group.

3.  Identify putative target genes for differentially methylated distal
    enhancer probes.

4.  Identify enriched motifs for the distal enhancer probes which are
    significantly differentially methylated and linked to putative
    target gene.

5.  Identify regulatory TFs whose expression associate with DNA
    methylation at motifs.

### Sub-menu ELMER: analysis

### Data: Create mee 

The [ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) input is a
mee object that contains a DNA methylation matrix, a gene expression
matrix, a probe information GRanges, the gene information GRanges and a
data frame summarizing the data. It should be highlighted that samples
without both the gene expression and DNA methylation data will be
removed from the mee object.

By default the function *fetch.mee* that is used to create the mee
object will separate the samples into two groups, the control group
(normal samples) and the experiment group (tumor samples), but the user
can relabel the samples to compare different groups. 

The following steps are required:

* Select DNA methylation object: select a summarized Experiment object with the DNA methylation data
* Select expression object: select a summarized Experiment object with the gene expression data
* Select group column: Select the columns with the groups. This column will be selected from the Summarized Experiment object.
* Select Experiment group: Select the columns with the subgroup 1 (experiment)
* Select Control group: Select the columns with the subgroup 2 (control)
* Select DNA methylation: Cut-off NA samples (%): By default, for the DNA methylation data will remove probes with NA values in more than 20% samples and remove the annotation data.

Also, for RNA expression data it will
take the log2(expression + 1) of the expression matrix in order to
linearize the relation between DNA methylation and expression.


![ELMER menu: Main window.](elmer.png)



#### Data: Select mee
 Select the R object (rda) file with a mee object created in the previous step.

#### Analysis parameters

After preparing the data into a mee object, we will execute the five
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) steps for both the hypo
(distal enhancer probes hypomethylated in the experiment group) and hyper
(distal enhancer probes hypermethylated in the experiment group) direction.

This box has all the available options for ELMER functions. Please see the [ELMER vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ELMER/inst/doc/vignettes.pdf). 

Also, a description of the data used by ELMER (such as the distal enhancer probes) is found in the
[ELMER.data](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/ELMER.data/inst/doc/vignettes.pdf)
vignette.

ELMER Identifies the enriched motifs for the distal enhancer probes
which are significantly differentially methylated and linked to putative
target gene, it will plot the Odds Ratio (x axis) for the each motif
found.
These motifs by default have a minimum incidence of 10 probes 
(that means at least 10 probes were associated with the motif)
in the given probes set and the smallest lower boundary of 95%
confidence interval for Odds Ratio of 1.1.

After finding the enriched motifs,
[ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) identifies regulatory
transcription factors (TFs) whose expression is associated with DNA
methylation at motifs. [ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/)
automatically creates a TF ranking plot for each enriched motif. This
plot shows the TF ranking plots based on the association score
$(-log(P value))$ between TF expression and DNA methylation of the
motif. We can see in Figure below that the top three TFs that are
associated with a motif found.

In case, it identifies regulatory transcription factors (TFs), an object with the prefix ELMER_results will be created
with the necessary data to visualize the results.

### Sub-menu ELMER: Visualize results
