# Introduction

TCGAbiolinksGUI was created to help users with limited programming knowledge to search, download and analyze 
TCGA data. This package offers a graphical user interface to the R/Bioconductor package [TCGAbiolinks]( 	http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks/) [@ref2] and [ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) [@ref4].
Additional packages from Bioconductor are included, such as [ComplexHeatmap](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/) package [@ref1] to aid in visualizing the data.

# GDC Data

## Menu: Get GDC Data

### Sub-menu: Molecular data

In this sub-menu the user can search, download and prepare GDC data.

![GDC search menu: Main window.](tcgasearch.png)

##### Advanced seach box

Based on the following filters, it will show a table with the following results:

* Database
* Project filter
* Data category filter
* Data type filter
* Workflow filter
* Sample type filter
* List of barcodes
* Clinical filtrer: gender, race, vital status, tumor stage


##### Download & Prepare box

After the search, the user can download the data and prepare it into an R object.
The data can be prepared into one of two formats:

* [Summarized Experiment](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n2/abs/nmeth.3252.html) 
[@ref3]
* Data Frame

If the Summarized Experiment object is selected, then the subtype and clinical information will be added.
The object will save with the same name as the file name field.

### Sub-menu: Subtype data

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has reported integrated genome-wide 
studies of various diseases. We have added some of the subtypes defined by these
reports in our package. The BRCA [@ref11], COAD [@ref12], GBM [@ref8], HNSC [@ref14], KICH [@ref15], KIRC[@ref21], KIRP [@ref20], LGG [@ref8], LUAD [@ref9], LUSC[@ref16], PRAD[@ref19], READ [@ref12],  SKCM [@ref13], STAD [@ref10], THCA [@ref18], UCEC [@ref17]. In subsequent versions, we will update this list.

The user can visualize the table with the information and save it as csv or an R object (rda) file.

### Sub-menu: Clinical data

Download GDC clinical data

Also, the summarized Experiment will be saved with all the results inside it and the new object will be saved with _result suffix.

Obs: Depending on the number of samples and the number of probes of interest, this analysis can last anywhere from minutes to days.  This is also dependent on the type of machine and hardware in which the analysis is running on.

### Sub-menu: Enrichment analysis

In order to better understand the underlying biological processes, researchers often retrieve a functional profile of a set of genes that might have an important role. This can be done by performing an enrichment analysis.

Given a set of genes that are up-regulated under certain conditions, an enrichment analysis will identify classes of genes or proteins that are over or under-represented using gene set annotations.

Change the size of the plot and the number of bars to plot

## Menu: Genomic analysis

### Sub-menu: Oncoprint

Using oncoPrint function from the [ComplexHeatmap](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/) package, this sub-menu offer a way to visualize multiple genomic alteration.

#### Data

* Select MAF file: Select a MAF file (.rda) with mutation annotation information
* Select annotation file: Select an R object (rda)  with the metadata information. Columns "patient" or "bcr_patient_barcode" should exist.
* Annotation columns: Which columns of the annotation file should be visible?
* Annotation position: Location of the annotation? e.g. Top or bottom.

#### Gene selection

* Selection: The user can select multiple genes from a list
* Text: The user can write a list of genes separated by ";" , "," or a new line
* File: Select a file (rda, csv, txt) with a column Gene_symbol or mRNA

#### Parameters control

* Remove empty columns? If a samples has no mutation it will be removed from the plot 
* Show column names? Show patient barcodes
* Show barplot annotation on rows? Show right barplot?

# Integrative analysis

## Menu: Starburst plot

![Starburst plot menu: Main window.](starburst.png)

### Data 
Expected input is a csv file with the following pattern:

* DEA result: DEA_results_Group_subgruop1_subgroup2_pcut_0.01_logFC.cut_2.csv
* DMR result: DMR_results_Group_subgruop1_subgroup2_pcut_1e-30_meancut_0.55.csv

### Thresholds control

The possible thresholds controls are:

* Log FC threshold: gene expression Log2FC threshold
* Expression FDR cut-off: gene expression  FDR cut-off (y-axis)
* Mean DNA methylation difference threshold: Mean DNA methylation difference threshold
* Methylation FDR cut-off: DNA methylation FDR cut-off (x-axis)

The options Mean DNA methylation difference threshold and Log FC threshold are used to circle genes which pass the cut-offs previously defined (eg. mean methylation or FDR).

### Highlight control
The possible highlight controls are:

* Show genes names: show names of significant genes
* Boxed names: show names inside a box
* Circle genes: Circle candidate biologically significant genes

### Other option

* Save result: save results in a csv file

## Menu: ELMER
This sub-menu will help the user to perform an integrative analysis between DNA methylation and Gene expression using the R/Bioconductor ELMER package [@ref4].

![ELMER menu: Main window.](elmer.png)

### Sub-menu ELMER: analysis
#### Data: Create mee 

ELMER works with a mee object, that has matched DNA methylation and gene expression data and divides the samples into two groups: experiment and control.

* Select DNA methylation object: select a summarized Experiment object with the DNA methylation data
* Select expression object: select a summarized Experiment object with the gene expression data
* Group column: Select the columns with the groups. This column will be selected from the Summarized Experiment object.
* Experiment group: Select the columns with the subgroup 1 (experiment)
* Control group: Select the columns with the subgroup 2 (control)

* DNA methylation: Cut-off NA samples (%): By default, for the DNA methylation data will remove probes with NA values in more than 20% samples and remove the annotation data.

#### Data: Select mee
 Select the R object (rda) file with a mee object created in the previous step.

#### Analysis

This box has all the available option for elmer functions. Please see the ELMER vignette. 

### Sub-menu ELMER: Visualize results
#### DATA

Select the R object (rda) file with ELMER results created in the analysis step.

#### Plot
Select ELMER plot. To access the plots, both the results and mee object must be selected. Please see ELMER vignette for more details. 

#### Results table
Select the ELMER results from the table. A results object should be selected.
