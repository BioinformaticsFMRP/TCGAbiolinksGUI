## Case: Integration of DNA methylation and gene expression for TCGA adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) samples

In this case study, we downloaded DNA methylation and gene expression for TCGA adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) samples, executed the Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis and Differential Expression Analysis  (DEA),  then both results were integrated in to a startburst plot.

## Case: Executing ELMER analysis on TCGA Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) samples

In this case we downloaded DNA methylation and gene expression for TCGA Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) samples. Then, this data is used to execute [ELMER](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ELMER/) analysis.
